Matt Artevate ("us", "we", or "our") operates the Idle City Runner mobile game (the "Service"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.

Information Collection and Use
We do not collect any personally identifiable information or user data directly from the players of Idle City Runner. However, please be aware that our game uses Google AdMob to display ads, and Google AdMob may collect certain information for the purpose of delivering personalized ads.

AdMob
Google AdMob is an advertising service provided by Google LLC. AdMob may use and collect information about your device, such as your device identifier, IP address, and geolocation data, to serve personalized ads to users. This information is used to tailor the advertising content to your interests and provide a more relevant ad experience.

Please refer to Google's privacy policy for more information about how Google AdMob collects, uses, and processes data: Google Privacy & Terms.

Opting Out
If you wish to opt-out of personalized advertising, you can do so by adjusting your device settings. For Android users, this can usually be done through the "Opt out of Ads Personalization" setting in your Google Account settings.

Children's Privacy
Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13 ("Children"). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your Children have provided us with personal information, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.
